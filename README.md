# System-Calls-and-Shell
1. Purpose This assignment intends (1) to familiarize you with Linux programming using several system calls such as fork, execlp, wait, pipe, dup2, and close, and (2) to help you understand that, from the kernel's view point, the shell is simply viewed as an application program that uses system calls to spawn and to terminate other user programs.
